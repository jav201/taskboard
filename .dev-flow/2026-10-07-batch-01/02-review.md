# Review — taskboard — Batch 2026-10-07-batch-01

> **Artifact language:** canonical English scaffold. Generate in the batch's development language (`state.json` `language`).
> Phase 2 artifact. Reviewers (in parallel): `architect` ∥ `qa-reviewer` ∥ `security-reviewer` by trigger family C (always in `full`).

> **Owed in.** `core` ✓ · `full` ✓

> **Field guide:** `templates/docs/review-template.md` explains each field below and the rules that read it. It ships with the flow and is not copied into this batch.

## ✅ Verdict (read first)

- **Gate:** `approve` → Phase 3  /  `iterate-to-refine` → Phase 1 (blockers present, or a requirement-defect major)
- **Out-of-scope findings:** `<N>` named and routed below  /  `none`

- **Findings:** `<B>` blocker · `<M>` major · `<m>` minor
- **shall/should check:** ✓ clean  /  ✗ misuse (blocker)
- **Two-layer (blockers):** ✓ every story has an `AT` · output reqs name deliverable+observation · both trace chains complete · ATs are genuinely black-box  /  ✗ `<which>`
- **Census (change-first):** done — best-effort + gate-confirmed  /  ⚠ incomplete   (NEVER stamp "VERIFIED COMPLETE")
- **Security:** ✓ no findings  /  ⚠ `<N>` findings
- **Evidence checklists (architect / qa / security):** ✓ all complete  /  ✗ `<missing>`

> If gate = `approve` and every line is ✓, the Detail below is reference. Any blocker/⚠ → read the matching part.

## Detail (reference)

### Findings
| ID | Reviewer | Severity | Area / Req | What | Recommendation | Status |
|----|----------|----------|------------|------|----------------|--------|
| `<one row per finding>` | | | | | | |

**A worked example — text to read, never rows of your record.** It sits in a fence so that nothing has to be deleted: a row copied out of it would claim a finding nobody raised. Write your own rows in the table above.

```text
| *(example)* F1 | architect | blocker / major / minor | | | | open / fixed |
```

### shall / should check
> Any modal `should` / `debería` inside an HLR/LLR statement is a writing error → blocker.

`<result>`

### Two-layer acceptance review (blockers)
> (a) every story has a black-box `AT`; (b) every output-producing requirement names its observable deliverable + observation method; (c) BOTH traceability chains complete (behavioral US→AT→outcome + functional US→HLR→LLR→TC); (d) each `AT` is genuinely black-box — drives the surface, asserts the outcome, references NO internal symbol.

| Story / Req | (a) AT present | (b) deliverable+method named | (c) both chains | (d) black-box pure | Status |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------|
| US-001 | yes/no | yes/no/n/a | yes/no | yes/no | ✓ / blocker |

### Supersession census (change-first)
> Planned new/moved/edited files checked against EVERY guard family (behavioral-placeholder · structural/placement · AST-composition · frozen-module). State reservations; the increment gate is the completeness guarantee, not this census.

`<files × families run · reservations · what the I-gate must confirm>`

### Security review summary
`<security-reviewer findings + verdict, or "not run — trigger family C did not fire" in core>`

### Evidence checklists (full) — architect · qa-reviewer · security-reviewer
> Attach each reviewer's completed evidence checklist (items in their agent files), ✓/✗ + one-line evidence.
