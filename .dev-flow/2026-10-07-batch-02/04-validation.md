# Validation — taskboard — Batch 2026-10-07-batch-02

> **Artifact language:** canonical English scaffold. Generate in the batch's development language (`state.json` `language`); for Spanish batches **translate the prose, never a label** — the reserved field names are declared in §✅ Verdict and are read literally.
> Phase 4 artifact. Content owner: `qa-reviewer`, who **EVALUATES** the results of the validation strategy fixed in Phase 1, **names who executed each one** and returns the rows; the orchestrator writes `04-validation.md` (`stations/shared-homes-roles.md` §Delegation). The ONE complete gate-suite run is the orchestrator's (`C-25`); a sub-agent consumes the result and never owns the run.

> **Owed in.** `core` ✓ · `full` ✓

> **Field guide:** `templates/docs/validation-template.md` explains each field below and the rules that read it. It ships with the flow and is not copied into this batch.

## ✅ Verdict (read first)

> **Reserved field names.** The **field names and block keywords below are language-independent** — the
> validator parses them literally and they are never translated:
> `Result` · `Layer 0` · `Evidence checklist` · `⏸ DEFER`
> Everything else on this page — headings, guidance, the prose in every cell — is translated with the batch.
> **One strategy, not two:** the flow ships no alias table, so a translated label is read as an ABSENT one and the rule keyed on it reports a true-sounding silence.
> **And one FLOW-WIDE reserved token, read out of this artifact by `V42` no matter which template minted it:** `⏸ DEFER`. It is a MARKER rather than a field name, which is why it is stated here *and* in `/dev-flow` §Language of artifacts rather than in a per-template list — a deferral can be written in any batch artifact, including the ones that carry no block at all.
>
> **And so are the three verdict tokens** `PASS` · `PASS-WITH-NOTES` · `FAIL`, which are VALUES and not prose.
> A Spanish batch writes `- **Result:** PASS`, not `- **Resultado:** aprobado`: the label, the tokens and the
> reviewer-identity tokens below are the machine's vocabulary.

- **Result:** `<PASS | PASS-WITH-NOTES | FAIL>`
- **Layer 0:** `<N unit(s) met the criterion · N carry a named reddening mutation>`
- **Requirements:** `<P>`/`<T>` pass · `<N>` blocker fails
- **Black-box acceptance (Layer B):** ✓ every story's `AT` observes its outcome through the shipped surface (boundary + negative)  /  ⚠ `<N>` stories with no deliverable observation
- **Surface-reachability (bidirectional):** ✓ all named inputs AND outputs/deliverables reached/observed at the surface  /  ⚠ `<N>` gaps
- **Supersession inspection (read off the P3 packets):** ✓ all surviving refs negative  /  ⚠ live dependency found  /  ⚠ no packet ran it
- **Test ledger:** ✓ reconciles (`base − D + A = post`)  /  ✗ mismatch
- **Evidence checklist (qa-reviewer):** `<reviewer · N of M rows ✓ with evidence>`

> If every line is ✓, the Detail below is reference only. Any ⚠/✗ → read the matching part.

## Detail (reference)

### Layer 0 — unit

| Unit | Which criterion | Node id | Result |
|---|---|---|---|

**Measured by mutation, never by line coverage.** For each unit, name the mutation and paste the RED:

| Unit | Mutation applied | RED observed? | Transcript |
|---|---|---|---|

### UX walkthrough — only if trigger family D fired

| Criterion (when the user does X, they observe Y) | Driven with the REAL mechanism | Painted result asserted | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|

**Mechanism used:** `<a UI test driver | a headless-browser driver | CLI subprocess | artifact on disk | none — inspected only>`

| Act | What it is | Performed? |
|---|---|---|
| Automated walkthrough | the criteria above, driven through the REAL mechanism | `<performed · not performed — <reason> · not applicable — no trigger-D surface>` |
| Expert inspection | a cognitive walkthrough against declared criteria, by a reviewer and not a user | `<same three states>` |
| Evaluation with users | real users of the system, doing the tasks named in the context of use | `<same three states>` |

- **Method:** `<how it was run — tasks, setting, whether the operator sat with the participant>`
- **Participants or population:** `<how many, and what makes them users of THIS system — no PII: no names, no contact details, no employer, no anything that identifies a person>`
- **Evidence of the evaluation:** `<where the record is — a path under the batch's declared `evidence` home, a transcript, an artifact on disk>`
- **Limits:** `<what this does NOT establish — sample size, self-selection, the operator watching, tasks chosen by the author>`

### Layer A — functional (white-box): per-requirement results
> `TC-NNN` ↔ LLR/HLR. `Result` = pass / fail. `Evidence` = command output, observed behavior, inspection note, or analysis result.

| Req | Method | Executed verification | Numeric threshold | Result | Evidence |
|-----|--------|-----------------------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| `<one row per requirement verified>` | | | | | |

**A worked example — text to read, never rows of your record.** It sits in a fence so that nothing has to be deleted: a row copied out of it would claim a verification nobody ran. Write your own rows in the table above.

```text
| *(example)* HLR-001 | test | `pytest … -k TC-001` | exit 0 | | |
| *(example)* LLR-001.1 | test (unit) | `…` | `…` | | |
```

### Layer B — behavioral (black-box) acceptance

| US | Acceptance test (`AT-NNN`) | Surface driven | Deliverable observed (path / element) | repr · boundary · negative | Result |
|----|----------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| `<one row per user story>` | | | | | |

### Bidirectional surface-reachability matrix (extends A-5)
> Every named INPUT dimension AND every named OUTPUT/deliverable is exercised/observed through the handler — not only the service API.

| Direction | US dimension / deliverable | Service param / producer | Reached/observed at surface? | TC / AT | Status |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|---------|--------|
| input | `<dimension>` | `<param>` | yes/no | `TC-NNN` | ✓ / gap |
| output | `<deliverable>` | `<producer>` | yes/no | `AT-NNN` | ✓ / gap |

### Signed-balance test ledger
> `post = base − D + A`. State counts in collected / passed-lean / passed-full form.

| base | − D | + A | = post | actual collected | passed-lean / full | reconciles? |
|------|-----|-----|--------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| `<N>` | `<N>` | `<N>` | `<N>` | `<N>` | `<N>` / `<N>` | yes/no |

### Gaps detected
| ID | Requirement | Gap | Severity | Proposed action |
|----|-------------|-----|----------|-----------------|
| G-001 | | | blocker / major / minor | |

### Escaped-bug regression (if a defect escaped the suite)

| Regression id (`AT-NNN` / `TC-NNN`) | Pre-fix run (evidence it FAILED) | Pre-fix RED kind (value / shape) | Post-fix value-discriminating? (QC-2) | Post-fix result | Reconciled node |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| | | | | | |

### Evidence checklist — qa-reviewer (full)
> Attach `qa-reviewer`'s completed evidence checklist (items in `agents/qa-reviewer.md`), each marked ✓/✗ with one-line evidence. An unchecked or evidence-less item blocks the gate.
