    `alert` on literal debt, blueprint on overdue and nothing else ("a calm
    sheet carries zero alert"). A log that reached for red on every ERROR
    would spend the one mark those languages guard, on the noisiest row on
    the screen.

    ASSERTED AS A WHITELIST rather than as "no alert token", and the
    difference is a finding: blueprint's `warn` token IS its `mut` token
    (`#7fa8c4` in both), so a test that banned the warn hue by value would
    have banned a neutral in one language and passed vacuously in the others.
    What the row may spend is the neutral family — ink, mut, dim — plus the
    accent on the live edge, and nothing else."""
